🫀 Heart Disease Prediction (Machine Learning Model)

📌 Project Description

This project is a beginner machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease using various medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other key health indicators.
The goal of the model is to help understand how different features contribute to heart disease risk and to build a reliable prediction system using common ML algorithms.

🧠 What I Learned

How to clean, preprocess, and analyze real-world medical datasets

Feature selection and understanding which health indicators matter most

Training different ML models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Desicion trees, etc.

Evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Handling imbalanced data and improving prediction results

Building a complete ML workflow: data loading → preprocessing → model training → evaluation

Saving the trained model using pickle/joblib for future prediction use
